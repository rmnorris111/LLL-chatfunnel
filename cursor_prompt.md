Options: ["Yes, for work", "Yes, for essential needs", "Both work and essential", "Not sure what qualifies"]

Trigger: "work" OR "essential" ‚Üí
Response: "Excellent! My fixed fee service is $899 + GST and covers everything you need. Would you like to know what's included?"
Options: ["Yes, what's included?", "How does the process work?", "What are my chances?", "Can I afford it?"]

Trigger: "what's included" ‚Üí
Response: "For $899 + GST, I'll prepare your complete application, review everything, and guide you through the process. Ready to get started?"

## 5. Knowledge Base Structure

### Core Legal Information
```json
{
  "eligibility_criteria": {
    "demerit_points": "Can apply if suspended for 56+ days, need work/essential driving",
    "court_disqualification": "Complex cases, depends on offence type and circumstances",
    "work_purposes": "Employment, business operations, essential medical appointments",
    "essential_purposes": "Medical appointments, caring for dependents, education"
  },

    "success_rate": "High for eligible cases"
  }
}
```

## 6. AI Integration Architecture

### Cloudflare Workers AI Setup
```javascript
// Primary AI for simple queries
const simpleQueries = [
  "what is limited licence",
  "how much does it cost", 
  "how long does it take",
  "what are my chances"
];

// Use Workers AI (Llama 2) for these
if (isSimpleQuery(userMessage)) {
  response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8', {
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: knowledgeBaseContext },
      { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
    ]
  });
}
```

### OpenAI Fallback for Complex Cases
```javascript
// Complex legal scenarios
const complexQueries = [
  "drink driving case",
  "repeat offender", 
  "specific court orders",
  "unusual circumstances"
];

// Use GPT-4o for complex legal advice
if (isComplexQuery(userMessage)) {
  response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: legalExpertPrompt },
      { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
    ]
  });
}
```
