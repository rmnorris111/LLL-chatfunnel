made simultaneously with the original logbook,—

made, by an enforcement officer in accordance with section 30ZH(3) or

removed by an enforcement officer from an accident scene where the driver is
incapacitated are an accurate statement of the truth of the matter required to be
recorded in the logbook by section 30ZF.

**65AB Qualifying offences**

(1) Section 65AC applies if a court convicts a person of an offence in relation
to alcohol against any of sections 56(1), 56(2), 57(1), 57(2), 57AA, 57C(1),
58(1)(a), 60(1)(a) to (c), 61(1), 61(2)(a), and 62(1)(a) and either—
(a) the person convicted has previously been convicted of such an offence
committed within 5 years of the date of the commission of the offence
being dealt with by the court (whether or not section 65(2) or (4) also
applies); or

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 6 s 65AB


```
(b) the offence for which the person is convicted involves either or both of
the following:

from an analysis of a blood specimen subsequently taken from the
person under section 72 or 73, is or exceeds 160 milligrams of
alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.
```
(2) However, section 65AI applies instead of section 65AC if a person described in
subsection (1)—
(a) has a medical condition (as certified by an appropriately qualified health
practitioner) that renders him or her incapable of providing a valid breath
sample to activate an alcohol interlock device; or
(b) usually lives in a non-serviced area and is not prepared to drive to a
serviced area for an initial installation and any necessary service; or
(c) has never held a New Zealand licence; or
(d) holds a licence that has been revoked or is suspended (except one that is
suspended under section 90, 95, or 95A); or

able to use it and fit it with an alcohol interlock device; or
(ii) have the type of possession described in subparagraph (i) of a
motor vehicle that is technically able to be fitted with an alcohol

**65AC Alcohol interlock sentence**

(1) If this section applies, the court must order an alcohol interlock sentence.

(2) An alcohol interlock sentence—

```
(a) disqualifies the person from holding or obtaining a driver licence for the
period required by section 65AE; and
(b) authorises the person to apply for an alcohol interlock licence at the end
of that period; and
(c) disqualifies the person from holding or obtaining any licence except an
alcohol interlock licence; and
```
Part 6 s 65AC **Land Transport Act 1998**

```
(d) authorises the person, after complying with the alcohol interlock licence
requirements, to apply to replace the alcohol interlock licence with a
zero alcohol licence.
```
(3) Subsection (1) applies unless for special reasons relating to the qualifying
offence the court thinks fit to order otherwise and, if so,—
(a) section 94 may apply (and a reference to disqualification in section 94
must be treated as if it referred to an alcohol interlock sentence); but
(b) an alcohol interlock sentence may not otherwise be substituted by a
community-based sentence.
Section 65AC: inserted, on 1 July 2018, by section 26 of the Land Transport Amendment Act 2017

person from holding or obtaining a driver licence for the period of disqualifica‐
tion that is appropriate under the provision relating to the qualifying offence.

of the following periods:
(a) 28 days; and
(b) any period when the person’s licence is expired or suspended under
section 90, 95, or 95A; and
(c) any period when the person is in prison (because of the qualifying
offence or otherwise); and
(d) any period when the person is disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driver licence, including—
(i) under section 65AD; or
(ii) under section 65AH(3); or
(iii) because of an existing disqualification (except a disqualification
under section 65(2) or (4): see section 65(3A) and (4A)).

**65AG Alcohol interlock licence requirements**

(1) An alcohol interlock licence replaces any licence held by a person.

(2) An alcohol interlock licence requires a person holding it to drive only a motor
vehicle or vehicles to which an alcohol interlock device is fitted.

(3) A person may apply under section 100A to replace an alcohol interlock licence
with a zero alcohol licence if—
(a) every motor vehicle the person has driven for 12 months (or more) had
an alcohol interlock device fitted and operating; and
(b) in relation to a person who is required to attend an assessment centre
under section 65 (or any other section), the person has attended and been
assessed as being a fit person to hold a driver licence; and
(c) during the previous 6 months, the person—
(i) has not attempted to drive while the person’s breath contained a
proportion of alcohol above the level to which the device is set;
and
(ii) has not committed a qualifying offence or an offence against
section 55A; and
(iii) has complied with any relevant regulations made under this Act.

(4) The 6-month period referred to in subsection (3)(c) may be reduced to
3 months if the person has been assessed at an assessment centre (whether
the attendance was voluntary or ordered by a court) as a fit person to hold a
driver licence.
Section 65AG: inserted, on 1 July 2018, by section 26 of the Land Transport Amendment Act 2017
(2017 No 34).

**65AH When court may take alcohol interlock sentence into account**

```
Fines, imprisonment, assessments, or community-based sentences
```
(1) A court must order any fine, imprisonment, assessment, or community-based
sentence that is appropriate for a qualifying offence or a concurrent offence
regardless of the requirement to impose an alcohol interlock sentence.

(2) However, the court may take into account the cost of an alcohol interlock
sentence and may discount the amount of any fine.
_Disqualifications_

(3) For a concurrent offence,—

```
Injury or death
(a) that resulted in injury or death, the court must disqualify the person from
holding or obtaining a driver licence for the period of disqualification
that is appropriate under the provision relating to the concurrent offence:
```
Part 6 s 65AG **Land Transport Act 1998**
5 April 2025


```
No injury or death
(b) that did not result in injury or death, the court may, taking into account
the alcohol interlock sentence that must be ordered for the qualifying
offence under section 65AC, choose not to order any disqualification
that might otherwise apply to the concurrent offence.
Section 65AH: inserted, on 1 July 2018, by section 26 of the Land Transport Amendment Act 2017
(2017 No 34).
```
**65AI Exceptions: persons who are not to be given alcohol interlock sentence**

```
If this section applies because an exception described in section 65AB(2)
applies to the person, a court must—
(a) disqualify the person from holding or obtaining a driver licence for the
period that is appropriate under the provision relating to the qualifying
offence; and
(b) order any fine, imprisonment, assessment, or community-based sentence
that is appropriate for the qualifying offence; and
(c) if a disqualification is ordered, authorise the person to apply for a zero
alcohol licence at the end of the period of disqualification.
Section 65AI: inserted, on 1 July 2018, by section 26 of the Land Transport Amendment Act 2017
(2017 No 34).
```
**65AJ Effect of subsequent qualifying offences on alcohol interlock sentence**

(1) This section applies to a person with an alcohol interlock sentence who is
convicted of a subsequent qualifying offence.

(2) The court must replace the alcohol interlock sentence with a new alcohol
interlock sentence under section 65AC unless—
(a) section 65AC(3) applies to the subsequent qualifying offence; or
(b) an exception described in section 65AB(2) now applies to the person (in
which case, section 65AI applies).

(3) Sections 65AC to 65AI apply to the new alcohol interlock sentence as if a
reference to a qualifying offence in those sections were a reference to the
subsequent qualifying offence.
Section 65AJ: inserted, on 1 July 2018, by section 26 of the Land Transport Amendment Act 2017
(2017 No 34).

**65AK Effect of other subsequent offences on alcohol interlock licence**

(1) This section applies to a person with an existing alcohol interlock licence—

```
(a) who is convicted of a subsequent offence that is not a qualifying offence;
and
(b) who is disqualified under this Act or under section 124 of the Sentencing
Act 2002 from holding or obtaining a driver licence for that subsequent
offence.
```
5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 6 s 65AK


(2) In order to continue the existing alcohol interlock licence, the court must
authorise the person to apply for a new alcohol interlock licence at the end of
the disqualification referred to in subsection (1)(b).

(3) Sections 65AG, 65AJ, and this section continue to apply to the new alcohol
interlock licence as if it were the previous alcohol interlock licence and the pre‐
vious alcohol interlock licence had not been interrupted by the disqualification.

(4) When the person applies under section 100A(1) in relation to the new alcohol
interlock licence, the Director must accept any compliance with the require‐
ments of section 65AG in relation to the person’s previous alcohol interlock
licence as compliance with the requirements of section 65AG in relation to the
person’s new alcohol interlock licence.

Enforcement procedures for offences involving intoxication
```
**68 Who must undergo breath screening test**

(1) An enforcement officer may require any of the following persons to undergo a
breath screening test without delay:
(a) a driver of, or a person attempting to drive, a motor vehicle on a road:
(b) a person whom the officer has good cause to suspect has recently com‐
mitted an offence against this Act that involves the driving of a motor
vehicle:
(c) if an accident has occurred involving a motor vehicle,—
(i) the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident; or
(ii) if the enforcement officer is unable to ascertain who the driver of
the motor vehicle was at the time of the accident, a person whom
the officer has good cause to suspect was in the motor vehicle at
the time of the accident.

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 6 s 68


(2) An enforcement officer may not require a person who is in a hospital or
medical centre as a result of an accident involving a motor vehicle to undergo a
breath screening test.

(3) A person who has undergone a breath screening test under this section must
remain at the place where the person underwent the test until after the result
of the test is ascertained, and an enforcement officer may arrest the person
without warrant if the person refuses or fails to remain at that place.

(4) If an enforcement officer is entitled to require a person to undergo a breath
screening test, the officer may also require that person to undergo a test using
a passive breath-testing device, which test is one where the officer holds a
passive breath-testing device near the person’s mouth for the purpose of ascer‐
taining whether or not there is any alcohol in the person’s breath.

(5) The use or non-use of a passive breath-testing device does not of itself affect
the validity of a breath screening test.

(6) An enforcement officer may require a person to undergo a breath screening test
whether or not a person has already undergone an oral fluid test under any of
sections 71A to 71C and regardless of the result (or failure to produce a result)
of any such oral fluid test or tests.

**69 Who must undergo evidential breath test**

(1) An enforcement officer may require a person to accompany an enforcement
officer to a place where it is likely that the person can undergo an evidential
breath test or a blood test (or both) when required to do so by the officer, if,—
(a) in the case of a person who holds an alcohol interlock licence or a zero
alcohol licence, the person has undergone a breath screening test under
section 68 and it appears to the officer that the breath of the person who
underwent the test contains alcohol; or
(aa) in the case of a person who is apparently younger than 20, the person
has undergone a breath screening test under section 68 and it appears to
the officer that the breath of the person who underwent the test contains
alcohol; or
(ab) in the case of any other person, the person has undergone a breath
screening test under section 68 and it appears to the officer that the
proportion of alcohol in the breath of the person who underwent the test
exceeds 250 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath; or
(b) _[Repealed]_

```
(c) the person fails or refuses to undergo a breath screening test without
delay after having been required to do so by the officer under section 68;
or
(d) the person could be required to undergo a breath screening test without
delay under section 68 but cannot be tested because either a breath
screening device is not readily available or for any reason a breath
screening test cannot then be carried out, and there is good cause to
suspect that the person has consumed drink.
```
(2) If it is not practicable for a person to undergo an evidential breath test at
a place to which the person has accompanied an enforcement officer under
subsection (1), an enforcement officer may require the person to accompany
the officer to any other place where it is likely that the person can undergo an
evidential breath test or a blood test (or both).

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that an enforcement officer may
require a person to accompany the officer to a place under subsection (1) if—
(a) it is likely that the person can undergo an evidential breath test at that
place, whether or not it is likely that the person can undergo a blood test
at that place; or
(b) it is likely that the person can undergo a blood test at that place, whether
or not it is likely that the person can undergo an evidential breath test at
that place.

(4) If a person—

```
(a) has accompanied an enforcement officer to a place under this section; or
(b) has been arrested under subsection (6) and taken to or detained at a
place,—
an enforcement officer may require the person to undergo without delay at
that place an evidential breath test (whether or not the person has already
undergone a breath screening test).
```
(4A) An enforcement officer who requires a person to undergo an evidential breath
test under subsection (4) must, without delay, advise the person—
(a) that if the person fails or refuses to undergo the evidential breath test, the
person will be required to permit the taking of a blood specimen under
section 72(1)(a); and
(b) that if the result of a blood test indicates the presence of alcohol in the
person’s blood the person may be issued with an infringement offence
notice or charged with an offence, depending on the proportion of alco‐
hol; and
(c) of the infringement fee payable for a breach of section 56(2B); and

```
(d) that the person may be liable to pay a blood test fee and associated
medical costs, whether or not the result of the blood test establishes that
the person has committed an offence against this Act.
```
(5) A person must—

```
(a) accompany the officer to a place when required to do so under this
section:
(b) if the person has accompanied an enforcement officer to a place under
this section, remain at that place until the person is required either to
undergo an evidential breath test or a blood test under this Act, or to
accompany an enforcement officer to another place under this section:
(c) if the person has undergone an evidential breath test under this section,
remain at the place where the person underwent the test until after the
result of the test is ascertained.
```

the circumstances in respect of which an evidential breath test was undergone
by the defendant, it is to be conclusively presumed that the proportion of
alcohol in the defendant’s breath at the time of the alleged offence was the
same as the proportion of alcohol in the defendant’s breath indicated by the
test.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings for an offence against this Act arising out of
the circumstances in respect of which a blood specimen was taken from the

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 6 s 77


(3) Except as provided in subsections (3B) and (4), the result of a positive eviden‐
tial breath test is not admissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence
against any of sections 56 to 62 if—
(a) the person who underwent the test is not advised by an enforcement
officer, without delay after the result of the test is ascertained,—
(i) that the test was positive; and
(ii) of the consequences specified in subsection (3A), so far as applic‐
able, if he or she does not request a blood test within 10 minutes;
or
(b) the person who underwent the test—
(i) advises an enforcement officer, within 10 minutes of being
advised of the matters specified in paragraph (a), that the person
wishes to undergo a blood test; and
(ii) complies with section 72(2).

(3A) The consequences referred to in subsection (3)(a)(ii) are—

```
(a) that the positive test could of itself be conclusive evidence to lead to that
person’s conviction for an offence against this Act if—
(i) the test indicates that the proportion of alcohol in the person’s
breath exceeds 400 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath; or
(ii) the person is younger than 20 and the proportion of alcohol in
the person’s breath exceeds 150 micrograms of alcohol per litre of
breath; or
(iii) the person holds an alcohol interlock licence or a zero alcohol
licence:
(b) that the positive test could of itself be conclusive evidence that the per‐
son has committed an infringement offence against this Act if the person
is younger than 20 and the test indicates that the person’s breath contains
alcohol but the proportion of alcohol does not exceed 150 micrograms of
alcohol per litre of breath.
```
(3B) Subsection (3) does not apply if the result of a positive evidential breath test
indicates that the proportion of alcohol in a person’s breath (other than a person
who is apparently younger than 20 or who holds an alcohol interlock licence or

alleged offence was the same as the proportion of the qualifying drug in the
blood specimen taken from the defendant.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings for an infringement offence against section
57A(3), 57B(3), 57C(3), or 57C(4), it is to be presumed in the absence of proof
to the contrary that a person’s oral fluid contains a qualifying drug if the results
of the first oral fluid test and second oral fluid test undergone by the person
indicate use of the drug.

(3) However, except as provided in subsection (4), the positive results of a first
oral fluid test and a second oral fluid test are not admissible in evidence
in proceedings for an infringement offence against section 57A(3), 57B(3),
57C(3), or 57C(4) if—
(a) the person who underwent the tests is not advised by an enforcement
officer, without delay after the result of the second oral fluid test is
ascertained,—
(i) that the second oral fluid test was positive; and
(ii) that the person will be presumed to have committed an infringe‐
ment offence against this Act if the person does not request a
blood test within 10 minutes; or

advised of the matters specified in paragraph (a), that the person
wishes to undergo a blood test; and
(ii) complies with section 72(2).

57B(3), 57C(3), or 57C(4).

(6) If it is proved in proceedings for an offence against section 60 that the defend‐
ant failed or refused to comply with section 13 without reasonable cause, that
failure or refusal may be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of
the prosecution, or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defendant,
concerning the defendant’s condition at the time of the alleged offence.

holding or obtaining a driver licence, the period of disqualification starts on the
day the order is made unless the court otherwise directs or that Act otherwise
provides.

(2) The person disqualified does not commit the offence of driving while disquali‐
fied contrary to section 32(1)(a) merely because, on the day of the making of
the order, he or she drove a motor vehicle on a road on that day before the
making of the order.

(3) In the case of a person who is at the time of the order already disqualified from
holding or obtaining a driver licence, the period of disqualification ordered
starts when the order or the last of the orders to which the person is already
subject ceases to have effect.

disqualified or was the holder of a limited licence issued under section
105 (or the corresponding provisions of a former enactment),—
the court must order the person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining

relating to the offence thinks fit to order otherwise or the court makes an order
under section 94.

subsection does not limit or affect any duty or power of the court to order a
longer period of disqualification.

a driver licence stop order because of the traffic fine described in that notice,
the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice may impose a driver licence stop
order on the defendant and issue it for service.

reissue a driver licence stop order that has previously been issued or reissued

issued, so that if, for example, the order is issued for 2 fines, the fee is 1
fee and not 2 fees; and

**94 Substitution of community-based sentences**

(1) This section applies if—

```
(a) the offender has previously been ordered on conviction for an offence to
be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence; and
(b) the court, having regard to—
(i) the circumstances of the case and of the offender; and
(ii) the effectiveness or otherwise of a previous order of disqualifica‐
tion made in respect of the offender; and
(iii) the likely effect on the offender of a further order of disqualifica‐
tion; and
(iv) the interests of the public,—
considers that it would be inappropriate to order that the offender be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence; and
(c) the court considers that it would be appropriate to sentence the offender
to a community-based sentence in accordance with Part 2 of the Sen‐
tencing Act 2002.
```
(2) Despite any provision of this Act that requires a court (in the absence of special
reasons relating to the offence) to order a person convicted of an offence to be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence, the court may instead
make an order referred to in subsection (3) if this section applies.

(3) If the court sentencing an offender determines under this section not to make an
order of disqualification,—
(a) the court must impose a community-based sentence on the offender; and
(b) the imposition of such a sentence does not limit or affect the power of
the court to impose any other sentence for the offence that, in accordance
with the provisions of the Sentencing Act 2002, it may impose in add‐
ition to the community-based sentence; and
(c) in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the offender in
respect of the offence, the court must take into account the gravity of the
offence and the fact that the offender would otherwise have been liable
to disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver licence.

Part 7 s 94 **Land Transport Act 1998**

(3A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the court may impose a sentence of

**98 Release of impounded vehicle**

(1) On or after the close of the impoundment period, the relevant person specified
in subsection (10), or a person authorised for the purpose by the relevant
person, or a bailiff or a constable executing a warrant to seize property under
section 94 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, or a Registrar, bailiff, or
constable executing a warrant of confiscation under section 132 of the Sentenc‐
ing Act 2002, is entitled to remove the vehicle from storage by—
(a) showing the storage provider proof of identity and either,—
(i) in the case of the relevant person specified in subsection (10), or
a person authorised for the purpose by the relevant person, either
the relevant person’s copy of the notice of acknowledgement of
seizure and impoundment or 1 of the following:
(A) if the relevant person is the registered person for the
vehicle, proof of registration of the vehicle in their name:
(B) if the relevant person is the owner of the vehicle, proof of
ownership of the vehicle; or
(ii) in the case of a Registrar, bailiff, or constable, the warrant; and
(b) paying the fees and charges for towage and storage of the vehicle, or
entering into an arrangement to pay those fees and charges.

(2) The storage provider is directed to release the vehicle as soon as practicable
after subsections (1), (6), and (7) are satisfied.

(3) An enforcement officer authorised for the purpose by the Commissioner may
order the release of an impounded vehicle at any time before the close of the
impoundment period if—
(a) the vehicle was impounded from an unlicensed driver; and
(b) that person has paid the fees and charges due for towage and storage of
the vehicle as at the time of payment and produces their current driver
licence to the officer.

(3A) In addition to the early release allowed by subsection (3), an enforcement
officer authorised for the purpose by the Commissioner may order the release
of a vehicle impounded under section 96AAA to the registered person at any
time before the close of the impoundment period if the registered person is a
person who—
(a) held a security interest in the vehicle before its seizure for impoundment;
and
(b) since the impoundment,—

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 7 s 98


```
(i) repossessed the vehicle under Part 3A of the Credit Contracts
and Consumer Finance Act 2003 or section 109 of the Personal
Property Securities Act 1999; and
(ii) became the registered person.
```
(4) If—

```
(a) 38 days have passed since the vehicle was impounded (whether it was
impounded for 28 days or 6 months); and
(b) the relevant person specified in subsection (10), or a person authorised
for the purpose by the relevant person, has not claimed the vehicle and
has not paid the fees and charges for towage and storage of the vehicle
or entered into an arrangement to pay those fees and charges; and
(c) no other person has, within that period, established to the satisfaction
of the authorised officer that the person is entitled to possession of the
vehicle,—
the storage provider may apply to an enforcement officer authorised for the
purpose by the Commissioner for approval to dispose of the vehicle, and any
personal property found in the vehicle, and may, with the officer’s approval,
dispose of the vehicle, and any personal property found in the vehicle, on the
terms and conditions that the officer thinks fit.
```
(4A) In making a decision under subsection (4) in relation to a vehicle impounded
under section 96AAA (and any personal property found in the vehicle), the
enforcement officer must have regard to whether the Police intend to take any
of the following proceedings:
(a) proceedings against the driver of the vehicle who failed to stop (or
remain stopped):
(b) proceedings against the registered person for, or hirer of, the motor
vehicle who, without reasonable excuse, failed or refused to provide
information or provided false or misleading information in response to a
request under section 118(4).

(4B) If the relevant person specified in subsection (10) has lodged an appeal under
section 102 or 110 , the enforcement officer must not approve the disposal
of the vehicle (and any personal property found in it) before the appeal is
determined.

(5) On obtaining approval under subsection (4), the storage provider becomes the
owner of the vehicle, and any personal property found in the vehicle, for all
purposes.

(6) However, before disposing of a motor vehicle under subsection (4), a storage
provider must—
(a) search the personal property securities register to identify every person
with a security interest in the motor vehicle; and

Part 7 s 98 **Land Transport Act 1998**
5 April 2025


```
(b) notify in writing every person with a security interest in the motor
vehicle.
```
(7) Before removing a vehicle under subsection (1), a bailiff or constable execut‐
ing a warrant to seize property under section 94 of the Summary Proceedings
Act 1957, or a Registrar, bailiff, or constable executing a warrant of confisca‐
tion under section 132 of the Sentencing Act 2002, must—
(a) pay any unpaid fees and charges referred to in section 97(2) related to
the vehicle to be removed; or
(b) enter into an arrangement with the storage provider for the payment of
any unpaid fees and charges that the registered person for the impounded
vehicle is liable to pay under section 97(2) in relation to the vehicle to be
removed.

(8) For the purposes of subsection (6), **security interest** has the same meaning as
in section 17 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999.

(9) Despite anything in subsections (1) to (8),—

```
(a) in the case of a bailiff or constable executing a warrant to seize property
under section 94 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the period
during which an impounded vehicle may be seized—
(i) begins immediately on the expiry of the applicable 14-day appeal
period specified in section 102; and
(ii) ends when—
(A) the vehicle is released under subsection (1); or
(B) the storage provider becomes the owner of the vehicle
under subsection (5):
(b) in the case of a Registrar, bailiff, or constable executing a warrant of
confiscation under section 132 of the Sentencing Act 2002, the period
during which an impounded vehicle may be seized—
(i) begins immediately on the impoundment of the vehicle; and
(ii) ends when—
(A) the vehicle is released under subsection (1); or
(B) the storage provider becomes the owner of the vehicle
under subsection (5).
```
(10) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (4)(b), the **relevant person** is—

```
(a) the registered person, if the vehicle is registered; or
(b) if the vehicle is not registered, a person who the enforcement officer is
satisfied is the owner of the vehicle.
```
(11) In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, **impoundment period**
means,—

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 7 s 98


```
(a) for a vehicle impounded under section 96, 96AAB, or 96A, the 28-day
period for which the vehicle was impounded:
(b) for a vehicle impounded under section 96AAA, the 6-month period for
which the vehicle was impounded.

(ii) the forfeiture of the vehicle under section 142AAB of that Act;

able efforts to contact the operator, the person in charge of the motor vehicle—
(a) may remove or arrange for the removal of the immobilising device from
the motor vehicle; and
(b) is not under any civil or criminal liability for the removal if it causes as
little damage to the immobilising device as is reasonably possible.

(6) This section does not of itself authorise an operator to apply an immobilising
device to a motor vehicle parked in a parking place.
Section 98D: inserted, on 2 January 2020, by section 4 of the Land Transport (Wheel Clamping)
Amendment Act 2019 (2019 No 70).

**98E Enforcement of section 98D and related matters**

(1) For the purpose of enforcing section 98D, and without limiting section 113, an
enforcement officer may remain in a parking place to—
(a) direct an operator to remove an immobilising device from a motor
vehicle within a specified time; and
(b) remove an immobilising device from a motor vehicle or arrange for its
removal.

(2) A person may enter and remain in a parking place for the purpose of removing
an immobilising device from a motor vehicle if an enforcement officer or the
person in charge of the motor vehicle has arranged in accordance with this
section or section 98D for the person to remove the device.

(3) In considering whether an operator has complied with section 98D(3) and
without limiting the generality of that section, regard must be had to any
criteria prescribed in regulations.

(4) To avoid doubt, section 98D(4) does not prevent a matter from being brought
before the Disputes Tribunal established under section 4 of the Disputes Tribu‐
nal Act 1988 for the exercise of that tribunal’s jurisdiction under that Act.

(5) In any proceedings before a Disputes Tribunal where an operator claims an
amount in respect of a dispute to which section 98D applies, no more than the
prescribed amount may be claimed.

(6) Nothing in subsection (5) affects proceedings before a Disputes Tribunal relat‐
ing to any damage caused to an immobilising device as a result of its removal
from a motor vehicle.

application is made,—
(a) has more than 1 year of an existing disqualification or disqualifications
left to serve; and
(b) has not been convicted in the previous 2 years of offences against any of
the following sections of this Act:
(i) section 35(1)(a) or (b):
(ii) section 36(1):
(iii) section 36A(1)(a) or (c):
(iv) section 36A(2) or (3):
(v) section 39(1):
(vi) section 56(1) or (2):
(via) section 57A(1):

(vii) section 58(1):
(viii) section 60(1):

offence against section 171 of the Crimes Act 1961 (manslaughter) in
which the manslaughter was the result of driving a motor vehicle; and
(d) has not been convicted of offences against section 32(1)(a) or (b) or (c)
in the last 6 months.

(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), (c), and (d), the date on which a person
has been convicted is the date on which a conviction has been entered against
that person.

(2) On an application under subsection (1), the court may, having regard to the
character of the applicant and the applicant’s conduct since the order was made,
the nature of the offence, and any other circumstances of the case, either—

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 8 s 99


```
(a) reduce the disqualification as from such date as may be specified in the
order or refuse the application; or
(b) treat the application as an application for an order under section 105 (for
the grant of a limited licence) and make an order accordingly under that
section.
```
(3) In having regard under subsection (2) to the conduct of the applicant subse‐
quent to an order disqualifying the applicant from holding or obtaining a driver
licence, the court must have regard to—
(a) whether or not the opportunity to attend a programme approved under
section 99A was reasonably available to the applicant; and
(b) whether or not the applicant attended that approved programme; and
(c) any report of a person conducting such an approved programme on the
conduct of the applicant, and on the applicant’s awareness of the respon‐
sibilities of drivers and suitability to hold or obtain a driver licence; and
(d) any report which relates to the medical condition of the applicant and
which is from a health practitioner attached to an assessment centre
attended by the person other than under an order made under section 65.

(4) If an application under this section is refused,—

```
(a) the court may accept a further application in respect of the same order if
satisfied that the application is supported by relevant evidence that was
not available when the previous application was heard; but
(b) otherwise, a further application in respect of the same order may not be
considered until at least 3 months after the date of that refusal.
```
(5) If the disqualification was ordered by the District Court, every application
under this section concerning that disqualification must be made to a District
Court Judge.

(6) If a court makes an order under this section and the person to whom it applies
is, before the end of the period for which the original order of disqualifica‐
tion was made, convicted of an offence for which the applicant is liable for
disqualification, the court must, whether or not it imposes a penalty for that
offence, order that the applicant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driver licence for the balance of the disqualification period specified in the
original order.

(7) No application or order under this section may be made by or apply to a person
who is subject to an alcohol interlock sentence or to an order made under
section 65 disqualifying the person from holding or obtaining a driver licence.

```
(B) has otherwise provided the information requested under

ately to the relevant person specified in subsection (6) or a person
authorised by the relevant person; and

**105 Court may make order authorising grant of limited licence**

(1) A court may at any time make an order under this section authorising the
applicant to obtain, immediately or after the expiration of such period as the

to drive to such extent (being the least extent that it is necessary to alleviate
extreme or undue hardship) as the court specifies in the order.

(2) The court may make an order under this section if satisfied that—

```
(a) the disqualification or suspension has resulted or will result in—
(i) extreme hardship to the applicant (whether in relation to employ‐
ment or otherwise); or
(ii) undue hardship to a person other than the applicant (whether in
relation to employment or otherwise); and
(ab) the applicant meets the criteria specified in sections 103 and 104; and
(b) an order under this section is not contrary to the interests of public
safety.
```
(3) In making an order under this section, the court—

```
(a) must specify—
(i) the purpose for which the limited licence is issued; and
(ii) the particular vehicle or the type of vehicle which may be driven;
and
(iii) the days of the week and times at which that vehicle may be
driven; and
(iv) such other matters as may be necessary to limit the order to
alleviating the hardship which was alleged and proved; and
(b) may specify in the order such other matters as the court thinks fit.
```
(4) If the application relates to a disqualification order made by the District Court,
the application must be made to a District Court Judge exercising jurisdiction

(5) If an application under this section is refused,—

Part 8 s 105 **Land Transport Act 1998**

```
(a) the court may accept a further application in respect of the same order if
satisfied that the application is supported by relevant evidence that was
not available when the previous application was heard; but
(b) otherwise, a further application in respect of the same order may not be
considered until at least 3 months after the date of that refusal.
```
(6) Subject to subsection (6A) and section 30(5), if the court makes an order under
this section, the Director must, subject to the provisions of this Act, issue to
the person entitled to it a limited licence in accordance with the order even
though—
(a) the person’s driver licence is suspended under section 90; or
(b) the person is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence.

(6A) If, after the court makes an order under this section, the Director becomes
aware that the applicant is not entitled to apply for or be granted a limited
licence in accordance with sections 103 and 104, the Director may—
(a) decline to issue the limited licence; and
(b) refer the applicant to the right of appeal under section 106.

(7) If the holder of a limited licence, or a person who is authorised to obtain a
limited licence but has not become the holder of such a licence, is convicted of
an offence for which an order of disqualification is imposed,—
(a) the limited licence is revoked or may not be issued (as the case may be)
and the original order of disqualification is revived and has effect for the
balance of the term for which it was originally imposed; and
(b) unless the court orders otherwise, the period of disqualification under
the revived order of disqualification runs concurrently with the order of
disqualification in respect of the second offence.

(7A) If a driver licence stop order takes effect in respect of a person who holds a
limited licence or is authorised to obtain a limited licence, then the limited
licence—
(a) is revoked or may not be issued (as the case may be); and
(b) may, when a driver licence stop order is cancelled under section 91G
or terminated under section 91H, be reissued or issued (as the case may
be) unless the person is otherwise disqualified from holding a limited
licence.

(8) A person who holds a limited licence that is revoked under subsection (7) must
immediately surrender their photographic driver licence to the court by which
the person was convicted, to an enforcement officer, or at an office of the
Agency (whether or not demand is made on the person).

(8A) The holder of a limited licence that is revoked under subsection (7A) must
immediately, and whether demand is made on the holder or not, surrender his

**118 Requirement to give information as to identity of driver or passenger**

(1) If an enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that the driver of a
vehicle has committed an offence while in charge of the vehicle, the officer
may request the registered person for, or the hirer of, the vehicle to give
all information in the registered person’s or hirer’s possession or obtainable
by the registered person or hirer which may lead to the identification and
apprehension of the driver of the vehicle.

(2) If an enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that a passenger
of a vehicle has committed an offence in or through the use of the vehicle
where that use relates to the commission of the offence or the aiding of the
commission of the offence or the assisting of that passenger to avoid arrest
in connection with or conviction for that offence, the officer may request the
registered person for, or the hirer of, the vehicle to give all information which
may lead to the identification and apprehension of the passenger.

(3) A request under subsection (1) or subsection (2) or subsection (6) may be made
orally or in writing and the registered person or hirer or licence holder (as the
case may be) must comply with the request within 14 days.

person’s or hirer’s possession or obtainable by the registered person or hirer
that may lead to the identification and apprehension of the driver, and the
registered person or hirer must give the officer that information immediately.

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply if the registered person or hirer has been arrested
or detained in relation to the suspected offence.

(6) If the holder of a transport service licence employs any person to drive a
vehicle under that licence, the licence holder, on being informed of any offence
alleged to have been committed by that person or by a person driving a
vehicle being used under the licence, and on being requested to do so by an
enforcement officer, must supply in writing the driver’s full name, full address,
and electronic address (if the driver has an electronic address).

driving offences), or is, or has recently been, driving under the
influence of drink or a drug, or both; and
(b) is freshly pursuing that person.

(2) The enforcement officer may, without warrant, in the course of the pursuit
enter, by force if necessary, any premises which the person has entered, for
either or both of the following purposes:

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 9 s 119


```
(a) determining whether or not a power conferred on an enforcement officer

building or place where a vehicle to which section 96, 96AAA, 96AAB, 96A,
or 123 applies is being stored or kept, and seize and impound the vehicle,—

(i) an enforcement officer has been freshly pursuing the vehicle; or
(ii) it is likely that a person was about to remove, conceal, destroy, or
dispose of the vehicle; or
(iii) an enforcement officer believes on reasonable grounds that the
vehicle was about to be used in the commission of an imprison‐
able offence (within the meaning of section 5 of the Criminal

Charges Act 2012 or any other enactment, even though the driver may
not otherwise be permitted to drive the vehicle to that site.

(2) The power conferred by subsection (1)(c) is also exercisable in respect of
a vehicle an enforcement officer believes to be a heavy motor vehicle or
transport service vehicle (other than a light rental service vehicle).

(4) The driver of a heavy motor vehicle or goods service vehicle must, whenever
directed by a sign specifying that that particular vehicle or vehicles of that

(1) An enforcement officer must direct the driver of a heavy motor vehicle or
transport service vehicle on a road to keep the vehicle stopped or remove it to a
place of safety approved by the officer and remain stopped there, if—
(a) the mass of a heavy motor vehicle or transport service vehicle on a road
is measured by, or at the direction of, an enforcement officer; and
(b) the gross mass of the vehicle, or the mass on a wheel, axle, or group
of axles of the motor vehicle, exceeds by at least 10% or by 2 000 kg

(ii) a mass or loading restriction specified in the vehicle’s certificate
of loading.

(2) The vehicle must remain at the place to which it is directed under subsection

passengers must be transferred to that alternative vehicle; but, if a suitable
alternative vehicle is not available within a reasonable time, the passenger
service vehicle must be permitted to proceed at a low speed, under the escort
of an enforcement officer, to a safe location that is suitable for handling the

fall or escape from the vehicle:
(c) it is no defence that the defendant’s conduct was not materially different
from that of other operators of heavy motor vehicles:

vehicle being towed by the vehicle, it is to be presumed that the operator of
the vehicle has not ensured that the load was secured or contained in such a
manner that it could not fall or escape from the vehicle, unless the falling or
escaping of the load occurred without fault on the defendant’s part.

(4) In proceedings for an offence against section 42, the court must, in determining

## 146A Average speed treated as actual speed

(1) In proceedings against a person for a speeding offence, the average speed of
the relevant vehicle between 2 detection points on a road calculated by a point-
to-point average speed system must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be
treated as being the speed at which the vehicle was actually travelling between
those 2 detection points.

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 10 s 146A


(2) The average speed of a vehicle between 2 detection points on a road is to be
calculated using the following formula (and expressed in kilometres per hour
rounded down to the next whole number):
(d × 3.6) ÷ t
where—
d is the surveyed distance (expressed in metres and rounded down to the
next whole number)
t is the period (expressed in seconds) between the time when the vehicle
passes the first detection point and the time when it passes the second
detection point.

(3) In this section and sections 146B to 146D, unless the context otherwise
requires,—
**data** , in relation to a speeding offence detected by a point-to-point average
speed system, means any form of data (including electronic images or a
sequence of electronic images) about any 1 or more of the following:
(a) the time of any event recorded (including the time a vehicle passed a
detection point):
(b) the position of a vehicle on a road at any given time:
(c) the direction in which a vehicle is moving:
(d) the characters on a vehicle’s registration plate:
(e) the average speed of a vehicle between 2 detection points:
(f) any speed limit or speed limits between 2 detection points:
(g) any self-test, diagnostic, or other data about how the system is operating
**element** , of a point-to-point average speed system, means any 1 or more of the
following:
(a) the 2 items of approved vehicle surveillance equipment at the detection
points:
(b) the location of the 2 detection points:
(c) the surveyed distance between those 2 detection points:
(d) if only 1 speed limit applies between those 2 detection points, that speed
limit:
(e) if more than 1 speed limit applies between those 2 detection points,—
(i) those speed limits; and
(ii) when those speed limits apply; and
(iii) the intermediate surveyed distance for each speed limit; and
(iv) the weighted average speed limit between those 2 detection
points, as calculated under section 146B

Part 10 s 146A **Land Transport Act 1998**
5 April 2025


```
intermediate surveyed distance , in a case where 2 or more speed limits apply
between 2 detection points, means the distance along the length of road where
each speed limit applies—
(a) measured by a cadastral surveyor licensed under the Cadastral Survey
Act 2002 in accordance with the method determined and published by
the Director after consulting with the Surveyor-General appointed under
that Act; and
(b) published by the Director under section 146D
surveyed distance means the distance between 2 detection points to which 1 or
more speed limits apply—
(a) measured by a cadastral surveyor licensed under the Cadastral Survey
Act 2002 in accordance with the method determined and published by
the Director after consulting the Surveyor-General appointed under that
Act; and
(b) published by the Director under section 146D.
Section 146A: inserted, on 1 March 2024, by section 30 of the Land Transport (Road Safety)
Amendment Act 2023 (2023 No 62).
```
## 146B Weighted average speed limit between 2 detection points

(1) This section applies if more than 1 speed limit applies between 2 detection
points on a length of road along which the average speed of a vehicle is to be
calculated for the purposes of section 146A.

(2) The speed limit for the purpose of that calculation is the average weighted
speed limit calculated under subsection (3).

(3) The average weighted speed limit for a length of road between 2 detection
points is to be calculated using the following formula (and expressed in kilo‐
metres per hour rounded up to the next whole number):
dt ÷ ((d 1 ÷ s 1 ) + (d 2 ÷ s 2 ) + ... (dn ÷ sn))
where—
dt is the surveyed distance (expressed in metres and rounded down to the
next whole number)
d 1 , d 2 ... dn are the intermediate surveyed distances (expressed in metres and
rounded down to the next whole number) over which the speed limits
between the 2 detection points apply
s 1 , s 2 ... sn are the speed limits that apply between the 2 detection points.
Section 146B: inserted, on 1 March 2024, by section 30 of the Land Transport (Road Safety)
Amendment Act 2023 (2023 No 62).

## 146C Evidence relating to average speed

(1) This section applies to proceedings for a speeding offence in which the average
speed of the vehicle under section 146A is relied on.

5 April 2025 **Land Transport Act 1998** Part 10 s 146C


(2) In those proceedings, the production of data relating to the alleged speeding
offence and purporting to be generated by a point-to-point average speed
system is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of the
accuracy of that data.

(3) In those proceedings, the production of a notice published under section 146D
describing an element of a point-to-point average speed system is, in the
absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of that element.

(4) In cases to which section 146B applies, the weighted average speed limit
calculated under that section must be treated as a speed limit in provisions in or
under this Act that impose different penalties for speeding offences depending
on the degree to which a speed limit is exceeded, and those provisions apply
accordingly.

(5) This section does not limit or affect any other evidence of the speed of a motor
vehicle in proceedings for a speeding offence.
Section 146C: inserted, on 1 March 2024, by section 30 of the Land Transport (Road Safety)
Amendment Act 2023 (2023 No 62).

**146D Publication of matters relating to point-to-point average speed system**

(1) The Director must publish—

```
(a) the elements of a point-to-point average speed system; and
(b) the method by which surveyed distances and intermediate surveyed
distances are to be measured for the purpose of the operation of any
point-to-point average speed system.
```
(2) The Director must publish those matters by notice—

```
(a) in the Gazette ; and
(b) on an Internet site maintained by the Agency.

## 146E Traffic control devices informing drivers of system

(1) If the Agency installs a point-to-point average speed system on a road, it
must ensure that, while the system is being operated, 1 or more traffic control
devices are in place that inform drivers passing the first detection point of the
presence of the system.

(2) In proceedings for a speeding offence in which the average speed of the vehicle
under section 146A is relied on, a certificate purporting to be signed by a
constable, a Police employee who is not a constable, or an employee of the
Agency, that states that 1 or more traffic control devices were in place on a date
no more than 1 year before the date of the alleged offence, is, in the absence
of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence that the device or devices were in
place as stated.

## 147 Evidence of accuracy of weighing devices and sites

(1) In proceedings for an offence against this Act or an offence against the Road
User Charges Act 2012 (or any regulations made under that Act), the produc‐
tion of a certificate (or a document purporting to be a copy of a certificate)
purporting to be signed by a constable or Police employee who is not a con‐
stable authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf (either generally or in a
particular case) to the effect described in subsection (2) is, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, sufficient evidence that the device or site to which the
certificate relates has been tested and was accurate on the date of the alleged
offence.

(2) A certificate referred to in subsection (1) may be to the effect that,—

```
(a) on a specified date, being a date not more than 12 months earlier than
the date of the alleged offence, a weighing device referred to in the
certificate was tested and found to be accurate by—
(i) an Inspector of Weights and Measures; or
(ii) an accredited person (within the meaning of the Weights and
Measures Act 1987); or
(iii) an employee of a laboratory for the time being approved for the
purpose by the Science Minister, by notice in the Gazette ; or
(iv) any other person who is approved for the purpose by the Minister,
by notice in the Gazette ; or
(b) on a specified date, being a date not more than 5 years earlier than the
date of the alleged offence, a site referred to in the certificate was tested
or surveyed, and found to be accurate, by—
(i) an employee of the Agency; or
(ii) a constable or Police employee who is not a constable; or
(iii) an employee or contractor of a laboratory for the time being
approved for the purpose by the Science Minister, by notice in the
Gazette.

and were—
(i) of the nature indicated by the mark, label, or placard; and
(ii) of the quantity (if any) indicated by the mark, label, or placard:
(b) if the vehicle or rail vehicle or load on the vehicle or rail vehicle con‐
tained any dangerous goods or other material, or food or food containers,

Emergency rules
```
**162 Agency may make emergency rules**

(1) The Agency may from time to time, in accordance with section 163, make such
emergency rules as may be necessary to alleviate or minimise any risk of the
death of or a serious injury to a person, or of damage to property.

(2) The Agency may not make emergency rules unless it is impracticable in the
circumstances of the particular case for the Minister to make ordinary rules, or
recommend that ordinary rules be made, to effectively alleviate or minimise the
risk concerned.

(3) The Minister may revoke any emergency rule made under subsection (1).

(4) The following are secondary legislation ( _see_ Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019
for publication requirements):
(a) emergency rules under subsection (1):
(b) a revocation under subsection (3).

(5) If, for reasons of safety, it is impracticable or inappropriate to publish immedi‐
ately an emergency rule or revocation under that Act, the Agency must serve a
copy of it on the persons (if any) whom the Agency considers appropriate.

(6) An emergency rule or revocation to which subsection (5) applies—

```
(a) has effect only in relation to a person on whom it is served under
subsection (5); and
(b) comes into force in relation to that person immediately after it is served
on the person (even if it is not yet published).
```

Publication** The maker must: LA19 ss 73, 74(1)(a),

- notify it in the _Gazette_ and specify a place where it is Sch 1 cl 14
available for inspection free of charge and for purchase
- make it available for inspection free of charge
- make it available for purchase by members of the public
at a reasonable price
However, that requirement does not apply if, for reasons
of safety, it is impracticable or inappropriate to comply
with that requirement. In that case, subsections (5) to (7)
apply

power in question is unlawful; and
(b) the applicant would suffer substantial harm from the exercise or dis‐
charge of the power or obligation; and

unlawful**

(1) This section applies in any case where it is declared, in a final decision given

197B, that the exercise of any powers conferred by that section is unlawful.

(2) If this section applies, to the extent to which the exercise of those powers
is declared unlawful, the Director must ensure that, immediately after the
decision of the court is given,—
(a) any information obtained as a consequence of the exercise of powers
declared to be unlawful and any record of that information are destroyed;
and
(b) any documents, or extracts from documents, that are obtained as a con‐
sequence of the exercise of powers declared to be unlawful are returned
to the person who previously had possession or control of them, and any
copies of those documents or extracts are destroyed; and
(c) any information derived from or based on such information, documents,
or extracts is destroyed.

(3) However, the court may order that any information, record, or copy of any
document or extract from a document may, instead of being destroyed, be
retained by the Director subject to any terms and conditions that the court
imposes.

(4) No information, and no document or extracts from a document, obtained as
a consequence of the exercise of any powers declared to be unlawful, and no
record of any such information or document,—
(a) is admissible as evidence in any civil proceeding unless the court hear‐
ing the proceeding in which the evidence is sought to be adduced is
satisfied that there was no unfairness in obtaining the evidence:
(b) is admissible as evidence in any criminal proceeding if the evidence is
excluded under section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006:
(c) may otherwise be used in connection with the exercise of any powers
conferred by this Act unless the court that declared the exercise of
the powers to be unlawful is satisfied that there was no unfairness in
obtaining the evidence.
