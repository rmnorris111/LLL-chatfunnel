# Limited Licence Lawyer: Background and Mission

## Overview

Limited Licence Lawyer is a legal service in New Zealand, founded by Rion Norris, specializing in assisting individuals who have lost their driving licence due to suspension or disqualification. The service focuses on preparing and facilitating applications for a 'limited licence' (also known as a 'work licence' or 'pink licence'), which allows eligible individuals to drive under specific restrictions, typically for work-related purposes.

## Mission

Rion Norris, the limited licence lawyer, is passionate about improving access to legal services. The core mission of Limited Licence Lawyer is to provide affordable and transparent legal assistance for limited licence applications. By offering fixed fees, the service aims to eliminate unexpected legal costs, making legal help accessible to those who need to regain their driving privileges quickly and efficiently.

## Services Offered

Limited Licence Lawyer offers a fixed-fee service for preparing limited licence applications. Key aspects of the service include:

*   **Application Preparation:** The lawyer prepares all necessary documentation for the limited licence application.
*   **NZ-Wide Service:** The service is available across New Zealand.
*   **No Appointments Necessary:** The process is streamlined to be convenient for clients.
*   **Legal Review:** The lawyer reviews the application to ensure accuracy and completeness.
*   **Guidance for Court and Police:** While the client negotiates with the police and attends court hearings, the service provides the necessary preparation and guidance.

## Understanding a Limited Licence

A limited licence is issued by the NZTA (New Zealand Transport Agency) to drivers who are disqualified or suspended. It permits driving under specific conditions, primarily for work, but can also extend to other essential reasons. The scope of driving (e.g., geographical area, vehicle type) is determined by the court based on the applicant's needs.

## Application Process & Key Considerations

*   **Stand-down Period:** For many court-ordered disqualifications, a 28-day stand-down period applies before a limited licence can be obtained. However, application paperwork can be organized during this time.
*   **Employer Involvement:** If the application relies on 


loss of employment as evidence of extreme hardship, employer involvement is necessary to provide supporting evidence.
*   **Legal Representation:** While not mandatory, seeking independent legal advice is advisable, especially in complex cases or those with previous convictions.
*   **Post-Disqualification/Suspension:** After the disqualification or suspension period ends, drivers must apply to a driver licensing agent to have their licence reinstated and a new licence issued.
*   **Strict Adherence:** Once a limited licence is granted, it is crucial to drive strictly within its terms. Failure to do so can result in the revocation of the limited licence and the reinstatement of the original disqualification.
*   **Court Appearance:** A court appearance is typically required. Applications for disqualification should be filed in the court that issued the disqualification, while suspension applications should be filed in the local court.
*   **Police Opposition:** Even if the police oppose the application, the court can still grant the order. However, engaging with the police is essential as their non-opposition can positively influence the court's decision.

## Fees

The fixed fee for the lawyer's services is $899 + GST. Additional court application fees apply:

*   **Court-ordered disqualification:** $165 (Court application fee) + $48 (NZTA application fee)
*   **Demerit points suspension:** $260 (Court application fee) + $65 (sealing fee) + $48 (NZTA application fee)
