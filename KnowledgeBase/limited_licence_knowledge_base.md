**Important note**: Applications can be filed during the 28-day period, but no licence can be issued until the period expires.

#### Vehicle class restrictions (subsection 2)
A limited licence may only authorise driving of vehicle classes for which the person held a licence or endorsement **immediately before disqualification**.

#### Prohibited purposes (subsection 3)
**No limited licence may be granted** to authorise driving:

##### (a) Professional driving instruction
For conducting driving tests or acting as a driving instructor

##### (b) Passenger services (with exception)
In passenger services, **unless**:
- Demerit point accumulation is the only reason for licence suspension, **AND**
- No more than 20 demerit points were accumulated whilst driving in a passenger service

#### Court examination requirements (subsection 4)
Unless parties agree otherwise, **no limited licence order may be made** until every person who filed an affidavit in support has appeared before the court for examination on their affidavit contents.

### Section 105 - Court may make order authorising grant of limited licence

#### Court's discretionary power (subsection 1)
A court may make an order authorising an applicant to obtain a limited licence (immediately or after a specified period) to drive **to the least extent necessary to alleviate extreme or undue hardship**.

#### Requirements for granting (subsection 2)
The court may make an order **only if satisfied that**:

##### (a) Hardship test
The disqualification or suspension has resulted or will result in:
- **Extreme hardship** to the applicant (whether employment-related or otherwise), or  
- **Undue hardship** to a person other than the applicant (whether employment-related or otherwise)

**Critical**: Normal inconvenience from losing a licence is NOT sufficient - hardship must be "extreme" or "undue"

##### (ab) Eligibility criteria
The applicant meets the criteria specified in sections 103 and 104

##### (b) Public safety
An order is **not contrary to the interests of public safety**

#### Mandatory specifications (subsection 3)
The court **must specify** in any order:

##### (a) Required specifications
- **Purpose** for which the limited licence is issued
- **Particular vehicle or type of vehicle** which may be driven  
- **Days of the week and times** at which driving is permitted
- **Other matters necessary** to limit the order to alleviating the proven hardship

##### (b) Additional specifications
The court may specify other matters as it thinks fit

#### Jurisdiction requirements (subsection 4)
Applications relating to District Court disqualification orders must be made to a District Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in the court that made the original order.

#### Refused applications (subsection 5)
If an application is refused:

##### (a) Further applications with new evidence
The court may accept a further application if satisfied it's supported by relevant evidence not available at the previous hearing

##### (b) General prohibition on re-application  
Otherwise, no further application may be considered until **at least 3 months** after the refusal date

#### Director's duty to issue (subsection 6)
Subject to other Act provisions, if the court makes an order, **the Director must issue a limited licence** in accordance with the order, even though the person's licence is suspended or they are disqualified.

### Section 65 - Mandatory disqualification and assessment for repeat offences

#### Scope (subsection 1)
This section applies to offences against **sections 56 to 62** (alcohol and drug-related driving offences).

#### Second or subsequent offences (subsection 2)
The court **must** make an order requiring:
- Attendance at an assessment centre
- Disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver licence until the Director removes the disqualification under section 100

**Applies when:**
- Court convicts person of second or subsequent offence against sections 56 to 62
- Previous offence was committed within **5 years** of current offence

**But only if at least one offence involved:**
- Breath alcohol exceeding **1,000 micrograms per litre**, or
- Blood alcohol exceeding **200 milligrams per 100 millilitres**, or  
- Offence against section 59 or 60 (failing to remain or permit blood specimen)

#### Third or subsequent offences (subsection 4)  
The court **must** make similar assessment and disqualification orders when:
- Court convicts person of third or subsequent qualifying offence
- Two or more previous offences were committed within **5 years** of current offence

#### Alcohol interlock replacement (subsections 3A and 4A)
Mandatory disqualification under section 65 is **replaced** by any alcohol interlock sentence ordered under section 65AC(1).

#### Impact on limited licence eligibility
**Critical point**: Persons disqualified under section 65 are **absolutely prohibited** from applying for limited licence under section 103(2)(a). This creates a complete bar with no exceptions or workarounds available.

#### Copies required for Police:

### Affidavit Requirements

#### Critical guidance:
- Affidavits must state **facts**, not assertions

- Penalty for false affidavit is up to 5 years imprisonment

#### Swearing/affirming affidavits:
- Must be done before a Justice of the Peace (JP), lawyer, or court registrar

### Police Engagement

#### Best practice:

- Police position is not determinative but their non-opposition helps
- Early engagement can resolve issues before court hearing

### Court Hearing Process

### After Court Order Granted

#### Step 1: Apply to NZTA

- Follow all specified conditions exactly

#### Consequences of breaches:

## Summary: Critical Points for LLM Reference

1. **Absolute prohibitions exist**: Section 65 disqualifications and other specified circumstances create complete bars to limited licence applications with no exceptions

2. **28-day stand-down periods**: Apply for serious driving offences, though applications may be prepared and filed during this time

3. **Hardship threshold**: Must prove "extreme" or "undue" hardship, not mere inconvenience - factual evidence required

4. **Public safety paramount**: All decisions must consider whether granting a limited licence serves public safety interests

5. **Strict compliance required**: Limited licences must specify exact purposes, vehicles, times, and conditions

6. **Multiple conviction rule**: Two qualifying offences within 5 years from different incidents can permanently bar applications

7. **Court discretion is structured**: While courts have discretion, they must follow mandatory criteria and specifications

8. **Jurisdiction matters**: Applications must generally go to the court that imposed the original disqualification

9. **Police position not determinative**: Courts make independent decisions regardless of police opposition or support

10. **Two-step process**: Court order does not equal licence - separate NZTA application required
